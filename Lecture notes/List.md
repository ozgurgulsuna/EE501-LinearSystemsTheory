## List ##

**Definition**: A [[list]] of [[length]] n is an ordered collection of n [[scalar]]s separated by commas and enclosed in square brackets.

$$\begin{align*}
\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)
\end{align*}$$

Since the list is defined with the length, each list is finite. The objects with infinite length are called not lists but **[[sequence]]s**.

Many mathematicitians call a list of length n a **n-tuple**. A list of length 2 is called an **ordered pair**, a list of length 3 is called an **ordered triple**.

Lists are also called **vectors**.
