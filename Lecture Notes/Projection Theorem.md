## Hilbert Projection Theorem ##

Let $H$ be a Hilbert space ( inner product space that is complete with respect to the norm induced by the inner product) and $M$ be a finite dimensioal subspace of $H$. Then for any $x \in H$, there exists a unique $y \in M$ such that

$$\min_{m \in M} \|x-m\|$$

has a unique solution $y$. In other words "we can find a unique point in $M$ that is closest to $x$". If $m^*$ 

**Proof:** **COMPLETE THE PROOF HERE**

**Remark:** The proof stated that $m^* = x_1$ is the closest point to $M$. It can also be interpreted as the best approximation of $x$ choosen from the vectors in $M$. The $x_2$ term is the error in the approximation.

<ins>Example:</ins> Let $V=\mathbb{R}^2$ and $M = \text{span}\{[1,1]^T\}$. Find the best approximation of $x=[1,2]^T$ in $M$.
