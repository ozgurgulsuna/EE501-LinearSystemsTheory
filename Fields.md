**Definition**: A field is a set $F$ with two operations, addition and multiplication, such that the following axioms hold:

**Addition**

(A1) $a+b=b+a$ for all $a,b \in F$ (commutativity of addition)

(A2) $(a+b)+c=a+(b+c)$ for all $a,b,c \in F$ (associativity of addition)

(A3) There exists an element $0 \in F$ such that $a+0=a$ for all $a \in F$ (existence of additive identity)
This element is commonly denoted by $0_F$.

(A4) For every $a \in F$ there exists an element $-a \in F$ such that $a+(-a)=0_F$ (existence of additive inverse)
This element is commonly denoted by $(-a)$.

**Multiplication**

(M1) $a \cdot b=b \cdot a$ for all $a,b \in F$ (commutativity of multiplication)

(M2) $(a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)$ for all $a,b,c \in F$ (associativity of multiplication)

(M3) There exists an element in $F$ such that $a \cdot 1_F = a$ for all $a \in F$ (existence of multiplicative identity)

(M4) For every $a \in F$ except $0_F$ there exists an element $a^{-1} \in F$ such that $a \cdot a^{-1} = 1_F$ (existence of multiplicative inverse)

(D1) $a \cdot (b+c) = a \cdot b + a \cdot c$ for all $a,b,c \in F$ (distributivity of multiplication over addition)

Field examples include $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{C}$, $\mathbb{Q}$, $\mathbb{Z}_p$ where $p$ is a prime number. $\mathbb{R}$ are the real numbers, $\mathbb{C}$ are the complex numbers, $\mathbb{Q}$ are the rational numbers, $\mathbb{Z}_p$ are the integers modulo $p$.

In a sense, what I understand from the fields are, mathematical concepts that are used to define the operations on the elements of the vector spaces.
